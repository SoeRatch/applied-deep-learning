# Fashion Classification & Anomaly Detection

This case study applies deep learning techniques to the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 grayscale images (28×28 pixels) of clothing items from 10 different categories. Compared to the traditional MNIST digit dataset, Fashion-MNIST offers a more realistic challenge while still being lightweight and easy to experiment with.

## Objectives

The case study is divided into two main tasks:

1. **Image Classification**  
   Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify clothing items into categories such as T-shirts, sneakers, coats, and bags.

2. **Anomaly Detection**  
   Use Autoencoders to detect irregular or corrupted images by analyzing reconstruction error.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to preprocess and structure image datasets for deep learning.  
- Building CNNs for image recognition and applying techniques like data augmentation and regularization.  
- Designing Autoencoders for unsupervised learning tasks.  
- Using reconstruction error to identify anomalies in images.  

## Why It Matters

The methods covered here are not only for learning purpose but also have **practical applications**, such as:  
- Automated product classification in e-commerce.  
- Detecting defects in manufacturing pipelines.  
- Identifying anomalies in medical imaging or fraud detection systems.  

By the end of this case study, you’ll have hands-on experience in both **supervised (classification)** and **unsupervised (anomaly detection)** deep learning approaches, and a foundation for applying them to real-world problems.
